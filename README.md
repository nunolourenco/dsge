# DSGE: Dynamic Structured Grammatical Evolution
# A python3 version is available here: https://github.com/nunolourenco/sge3

Structured Grammatical Evolution (SGE) is a recent Grammatical Evolution (GE) variant that aims at addressing some of its locality and redundancy issues. The SGE distinctive feature is having a one-to-one correspondence between genes and non-terminals of the grammar being used. If you use this code, a reference to the following work would be greatly appreciated:

This project corresponds to a new implementation of the SGE engine. SGE has been criticised for the fact that we need to specify the maximum levels of recursion in order to remove it from the grammar beforehand. In this new version we specify the maximum tree depth (similarly to what happens in standard tree-based GP), and the algorithm adds the mapping numbers as required during the evolutionary search. Thus, we do not need to pre-process the grammar to remove the recursive productions. Additionally, we provide mechanisms and operators to ensure that the generated trees are always within the allowed limits.


As in for the SGE framework we provide the implementations of some problems that we used to test the DSGE. Extending it to your own needs should be fairly easy. 


When running the framework a folder called *dumps* will be created together with an additional one that corresponds to the experience. Inside, there will be directories for each run. Each run folder contains snapshots of the population at a given generation, and a file called *progress_report.csv*,  which is assembled by the end of the evolutionary run. By default we take snapshots of the population at the following generations: 0,25 and 50. This can be changed, together with all the numeric values in the *configs* folder.

### Requirements
Currently this codebase only works with python 2. 

### Instalation

To run the default examples, you should be inside the *src* directory and then type:

`python -m examples.[problem_name] [run]`

### Support

Any questions, comments or suggestion should be directed to Nuno Lourenço ([naml@dei.uc.pt](mailto:naml@dei.uc.pt))

### Acknowledgments

I am gratefull to my advisors Francisco B. Pereira and Ernesto Costa for their guidance during my PhD. I am also gratefull to Filipe Assunção and Joaquim Ferrer for their help and comments on the development of this framework.
